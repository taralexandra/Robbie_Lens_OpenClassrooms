### About this project

Everything here is in french. This is a tutorial a followed with the website Openclassrooms, coding a very first website in HTML and CSS for a photographer "Robbie Lens" ðŸ“¸. 
I made this tuto in april or may 2024 ðŸ“†. 

I know all the files are not perfectly organized but this was my very first project, i accept that everything is not perfect ! 

I am pretty happy with the result anyway. ðŸ¥°
