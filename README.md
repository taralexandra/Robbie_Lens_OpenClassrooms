### About this project

Everything here is in french. This is a tutorial a followed with the website Openclassrooms, coding a very first website in HTML and CSS for a photographer "Robbie Lens" 📸. 
I made this tuto in april or may 2024 📆. 

I know all the files are not perfectly organized but this was my very first project, i accept that everything is not perfect ! 

I am pretty happy with the result anyway. 🥰

If you want to see the tutorial, as i said, in french, please access to the website of OpenClassrooms :

### Some updates i would make on this project 🛠️ 👷‍♀️ :
while testing the online version, i discovered this is not possible to close the pictures of the Portfolio part when we already clicked on it 🤔, i clearly want to add the possibility to click on a cross to close the picture and see the others pictures, or some arrows to be able to navigate between the pics. But onestly, I am currently learning  JS (november 2024 🗓️) and not able to do so today, this is something i planned to make anyway one day, in the coming months.
